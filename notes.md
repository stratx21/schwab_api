conditions before trade:
  - before 5min before market close 
  - after 10min after market open ? 
  - voloume trending up? 
  - B/A spread big enough
  - no current trade occurring 
  - replace order only if 0.5s has passed? 
  - replace buy order if sell order executed (and vice versa) ?


answers from questions:
  - margin only charged when held overnight
  - Day Trade Buying Power = 4x margin at market open
  - margin based on value of the assets in the account 
  - cash accounts are not affected by PDT rule - only margin 


outstanding questions:
  - how much Day Trade Buying Power will I have on a margin account? 
  - I haven't actually shorted a stock before.. how does margin work with that?
    - margin would only decrease by the buy price when buying right? 
    - For example, if a sell order executes first, then a buy, does the margin available for the day decrease by the buy price only? or sell? or both?

potential BA spread stocks:
  - VGT (high price though)
  - FNGU (10-20k volume)
  - LABU
  - NVDA
  - BLK (slightly lower volume than VGT, large spread though)
  - MPWR (massive spread) - noticed ask did not move up when a higher value was offered, but at < 100 shares
  - SMCI - lots of volume, big spread       X - too volatile I think 
  - NFLX - plenty of volume, large spread
  - INTU
  - GBTC


potential idea: 
  - set buy limit 1c below bid, set sell limit 1c above ask
    - !! - or, right at bid/ask
  - continue to adjust
  - it will only buy when it goes down slightly, only sell when it goes up slightly 
  - but with the continuous adjustment of the order, it will require high volume moves
  - !! - as the stock price moves with volatility up and down it should execute both.. probably 
  - !! - could use very high volume stocks 
  - ?? - try it out, it won't cost much to try 
NOT going to work for a tight B/A spread -  if it jumps down and sells, then the sell adjusts to a lower price, I'm selling for lower than what I bought for 



day trade buying power
   - recycles each day
   - sell bought that day, recycles for the same day
